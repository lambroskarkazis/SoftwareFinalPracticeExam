### Question 1

Our group took a number of steps to manage complexity.

1. We used Github as source control.
2. We implemented the .NET MVC architecture.
3. We used Visual Studio's IntelliSense.

#### Github
Source control enabled the team to effectively collaborate. If a problem occurred git enabled us to pinpoint which changes caused the problem. Further, it ensured that different collaborators did not interfere with one another while developing. Oftentimes, no merge conflicts occurred.  

#### .NET MVC
Our choice of framework eased complexity. The framework has great documentation. Many have used it, so we could avoid other's mistakes. The MVC architecture adequately separates the project's parts.

#### Visual Studio
Visual Studio manages complexity with code highlighting and IntelliSense. By presenting software well, the programmer can better manage the codebase. IntelliSense allows programmers to understand the context of a code snippet. Further, it directly indicates when a developer makes incorrect assumptions.
